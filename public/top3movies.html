    <h1>My favourite Movies of all time</h1>
    <h2>Top 3</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>1. Joker</h3>
    <p>The acting and storyline makes this movie simply spectacular. <br /> 
       It touched me in so many ways as you really feel sorry for Arthur.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Ace Ventura 1 & 2</h3>
    <p>I know! These are 2 seperate movies, but I'm always conflicted on which one is best. <br />
    I often find myself loving one or the other over the other, so both have to go in. <br />
    Really funny films     
</p>

    <h3>3. Cool Runnings</h3>
    <p>A Jamaican team goes to Calgary (one of the coldest places on earth) to compete in the olympics as bobsledders. <br />
       Based on a true story, although slightly changed for comedy, I find many belly laughs with this film along with a teary eye at the end. <br />
       And this is why it comes in as my 3rd most favourite film of all time.
    </p>
    
    <p>These films might seem boring in many ways to some people, but as I grew up in the 90's, and in much simpler times, I find that these were the peak of some of my favourite actors and films.
    <br /> 
    And therefore, I'm right :).
